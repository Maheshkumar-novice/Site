This is a repo which will serve my blog page's index page.

The page will be like my portfolio.

I will be showing the following information,
* https://github.com/Maheshkumar-novice
* https://maheshkumar-novice.github.io/GoWeblogs/
* https://mahi-novice.bearblog.dev/

Along with the index page html code. We will have an MD page that shows the instructions for setting up https for our domain.

DOMAIN: maheshkumar.blog

And then we will have instructions for setting up nginx.

Finally we will have our nginx conf file that will store our nginx configuration of our site.

Remember not to store any sensitive information here as it will be a public github repo. So replace sensitive info with placeholders always.
